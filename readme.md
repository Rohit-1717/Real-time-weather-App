# Weather AI - GenAI Project

**Weather AI** is a **Generative AI**-powered React application that interacts with an AI model to determine the weather for a specified city. The app integrates **FastAPI** for the backend and uses the **Google Gemini API** to process natural language queries, followed by fetching weather data and providing a simulated AI thinking process.

## Features

- **AI-based Weather Query**: Users can input natural language queries like "What's the weather in <city>?" to get the current weather.
- **Generative AI Thinking**: The app uses **Google Gemini** API to process the user's query and simulate a multi-step reasoning process to fetch weather information.
- **Weather Icons**: Displays an appropriate weather icon (e.g., üåßÔ∏è for rain, ‚òÄÔ∏è for clear skies) based on the weather description.
- **Detailed AI Steps**: Provides detailed AI thought processes and reasoning in a step-by-step manner for transparency.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Generative AI Model**: Google Gemini API
- **Weather API**: Custom backend to fetch weather data
